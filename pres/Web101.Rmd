## Fundamentally
It's about making various files available for consumption by different types of systems.



# Anatomy
## Call & response
90s rap structure (call & response) was most certainly based on the internet.

- **You** make a *call* or *request*
- **Server** gives a *response*

## Data and metadata
Requests and responses can consist of two parts: 

- metadata: headers
- data: body or content

# Content

## Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML)
HTML is designed to provide instructions to client about the information being delivered by the file. It includes information like whether data is part of a table.

```html
<a href="link.html">Relative link</a>
```

## JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
JSON is a purely data oriented markup.

```json
"name": "Steph"
```

## XML 
XML is a language partways between JSON and HTML. It uses double tags like HTML but is intended for data.

```xml
 <person>
 <FirstName>Steph</FirstName>
 </person>
```
